*Blog updates* -- students are required to keep a blog to which they post updates
about their investigations, progress, success, and pitfalls.  This blog can be
hosted anywhere, but must be added to the course `planet
<http://threebean.org/floss-planet/>`_ (there are instructions on how to do this
in :doc:`hw/fflight`).

 - You must make at least one blog post per week to receive full credit.
 - You must participate regularly in the course's IRC channel: asking and
   answering questions.
 - You must participate in the course's mailman list,
   `floss-seminar@lists.rit.edu
   <https://lists.rit.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/floss-seminar>`_.
 - Contributions to the course curriculum, syllabus, and rubric are factored in
   here as well.

Blogging is good for you and good for the `FLOSS community at large
<http://xkcd.com/979/>`_.
