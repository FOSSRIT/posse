*Blog updates* -- students are required to keep a blog to which they post updates
about their investigations, progress, success, and pitfalls.  This blog can be
hosted anywhere, but should be added to the TOS `planet
<http://planet.teachingopensource.org/>`_ (there are instructions on how to do this
in :doc:`hw/fflight`).

Blogging is good for you and good for the `FLOSS community at large
<http://xkcd.com/979/>`_.
