Day 4: 
=======

Thursday we'll be talking about the social aspects of collaboration, and a little bit today. Broadly speaking, it has it's own culture, and many subcultures within each project. Depending on the nature of the project, there are differences.

How do FOSS projects are presented/deisseminated, and how to attract contributors.

Bus/Raptor Tests, speak to the notion of sustainability in development/collaboration. We've left a block open to particpants to post topics and issues related to FOSS. We'll poll people for specific topics.

Thursday Night will be a celebration/graduation dinner.
