Day 1: Introduction to Open Source
==================================

Lib arts components today/tomorrow, transition to tech matters later in week.

History and Terminology in the Morning: What Open Source Is

Then we jump into History of IP

and then take a break at lunch

After lunch, we'll be going over communication tools (IRC, Mailing Lists, etc...) and go into distributed collaboration and open source process. We'll talk about other tools as well, wikilab, basic communication tools, blogs, planets, and others. These are basic elements of FOSS collaboration and communication.

Lastly we'll talk about how to find things out on the web, and digging for answers. Where do you start, how do you find things out, and the concept of being "productively lost."
