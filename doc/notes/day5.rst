This year, created an afterschool program through a ChaseManhattan grant called "East High College Readiness program" designed an ARG (augmented reality game) with post-apocalyptic island in the south atlantic with robots. Students had to use math problems to advance. The idea was to have students blog, and then add their blogs to an aggregated planet. That program was a pilot, and will continue this fall and hopefully expand. All materials will be made available and publicized after POSSE is done.

Second stage of HFOSS course tried to used:
Openshift  https://openshift.redhat.com/app/
Did not work well, issues with environment.  Much time productively lost.
first course fairly project regimented
second course more seminarish
A third course has been put together by Cody VanDeMark
Software development on linux.  Open source software development.  Course is on TOS  http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Teaching_Materials_Catalogue
Mark to Steve: Do you have a vision for where you would like this to go?  I have a secret plan for the future only until I have put you all under virtual NDA.  Heheh.  There are very few centers like the FOSSBOX.  
STEVE:
I didn't know step one about open source until the OLPC did their 
"Give one, get one."  Service learning/work is very important to me.  Anyone who is lucky enough to get to college owes something to the larger world.  Built many not for profit websites in the 90's and early 2000's.  IF organizations wanted us to work ont heir stuff they had to send someone to the class.  
Started OLPC user group so I wd have folks brains to pick.  Nate was in first class.  Students at the end asked "where do we go from here?"
We have coops.  Sugar labs is a 501c3.  RIT allows students to work at 501c3's.  Students jumped in and recruited other students themselves.  Organic growth of students working on projects, tkinng classes, not for profit coops, and paid coops.  Little enging going.  Benefits for students.  papers for me.  Undergrad fellowships to work on projects.  80 % project student originated.  Occasionally some come from me.  Remy came on board by stages from Red Hat.  It works; got a couple of papers out of it.  What it lets us do we have a got a group of students.  RPI is doing this.  Got a million bucks to start a lab froma n alum who made his money in OS.  Oregon State University, Seneca College (Chris Tyler)--Mozilla funding.  Canandian version of NSF just gave Chris a 5 year grant open hardware, porting red hat stuff to raspberry pi.  Antonio Mondragon. Andrea Hickerson rise above the crowd, for Imagine RIT.  She is trying to get journalism students to write about Open Source. South by Southwest women & sexism and obstructionism in the open source community.
