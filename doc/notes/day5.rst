This year, created an afterschool program through a ChaseManhattan grant called "East High College Readiness program" designed an ARG (augmented reality game) with post-apocalyptic island in the south atlantic with robots. Students had to use math problems to advance. The idea was to have students blog, and then add their blogs to an aggregated planet. That program was a pilot, and will continue this fall and hopefully expand. All materials will be made available and publicized after POSSE is done.
