Day 2: Collaboration
====================

Introduction to an assignment on Community Architecture: finding an existing FOSS project, profile the contributors, arranged in groups of 2-4, and presenting the profiles on Friday.

After that, we'll jump into version control with Git and Github.

After lunch, we're going to do a practice run on making changes to a code base. We'll walk you through a practice example.

After we'll jump into documentation, the need for it, the form of it, and it's importance in the context of FOSS development.
