# This is a database of all the students taking the course.
#
# By keeping this in a marked-up format in the public source repository, we can
# write neat scripts that scrape, monitor, and aggregate data about the course.
#
# Add yourself to the following list (insert yourself in alphabetical order).
# The required keys are 'name', 'rit_dce' (this is your RIT username), 'blog'
# (this is a URL to your blog you'll be using for the course), 'irc' (your IRC
# nick), and 'forges' (a list of URLs to any public forges you are on).
#
# Once you've modified this, there is a script located at
# lib/ritfloss/model/validate.py you can run to see if you have any syntax
# errors or problems with your entry.
#
# Once done and validated, you should:
#
#  - commit this in git
#  - push back to your forked repository on github.com
#  - issue a pull request on the upstream repository to be considered for a
#    merge.
